#### 2.5 REDCap Security Guidance

## 2.5.1. REDCap Security Checklist


Ensure that the hosting environment is institutionally approved for the data’s risk level.
All access uses SSO/MFA where available.
User rights follow least-privilege; DAGs are correctly configured.
Identifiers are minimised; RECORD ID is non-meaningful.
Surveys are configured appropriately (anonymous vs identified).
Free-text and file-upload fields are justified and controlled.
Data validation and Data Quality Rules are defined.
Mobile app use (if any) is explicitly approved and documented.
API access is restricted, and tokens are protected.
Export procedures (R/Excel) are defined, with de-identification and secure storage.
Logs and security settings are periodically reviewed.
Training and SOPs are in place; incident response is understood by the team.
Purpose and scope

## 2.5.1.2

This document outlines good practice for using REDCap securely throughout the project’s lifecycle: platform hosting, project setup, day-to-day use, integrations, mobile/offline use, and data exports. It is aimed at:
--- Institutional IT / information security
--- REDCap administrators
--- PIs / project owners and data managers
--- Study staff and analysts
--- Anyone using the REDCap API or mobile app
REDCap is technically capable of meeting HIPAA, GDPR and similar standards when implemented correctly, but compliance depends on how the system is configured and used, not on the software alone. Always interpret this guidance alongside organizational policies, ethics approvals, and other aapplicable regulations.

## 2.5.2 Roles and Responsibilities
  Institutional IT security
Provide a secure hosting environment (patched OS, firewalls, intrusion detection, backups, disaster recovery).
Enforce TLS/SSL for all traffic and strong authentication (SSO, MFA).
Maintain written policies for REDCap use (data classification, incident response, user onboarding); this will largely be managed by Civic Health Innovation Labs.

  REDCap Administrator
Configure global security settings (SSL, timeout, password rules, 2FA).
Approve/manage user rights, control external modules and API access.
Monitor logs; coordinate with IT on upgrades and patches.

  Project Owner 
Ensure ethical and regulatory approvals include REDCap.
Approve project design, user access, Data Access Groups (DAGs) and export permissions.

  Study staff / data entry users
Use REDCap for approved purposes and populations.
Report suspected incidents to IT or Civic Health Innovation Labs immediately.

  Analysts / statisticians
Request only data needed for analysis; use de-identified exports where possible.
Store exported datasets securely and in line with institutional policy.
Avoid re-identification attempts unless explicitly approved.

  Platform-level security (server and network)
REDCap must use a hardened server, regular patching and restricted shell access.
All web traffic must use HTTPS with TLS; HTTP is disabled (lower Security).
Database and file storage exists on a secured institutional infrastructure, with:
Encrypted storage where required by policy.
Regular, tested backups and documented disaster recovery.
Network controls (firewalls, proxies, VPNs) should limit access to trusted networks.

This list primarily concerns institutional responsibilities; end-users should not assume that the server is secure without confirmation from local documentation or the REDCap team.

## 2.5.3 Application-level Security Features
Configure automatic session timeouts and account inactivity lockout (e.g. 15-minute idle logout; 90-day inactivity suspension).

--- Use roles (PI, Data Entry, Statistician, Viewer) to apply least-privilege permissions.
--- Use Data Access Groups (DAGs) to segregate multi-site data.
--- Restrict high-risk actions (project design, DAGs, exports, APIs) to specific users.
--- REDCap provides a comprehensive audit trail that logs all user activity, including data views, edits, exports, user and project changes. Administrators and Project Owners should:
--- Periodically review logs for suspicious activity.
--- Retain logs according to institutional policy.
--- Use logs in incident investigation and monitoring.
--- Real-time validation, range checks and required fields not only improve data quality but also reduce the risk of inadvertently entering data into an incorrect field. Configure:
--- Validation for dates, numbers, emails, names, and all data types
--- Data quality rules should be used to detect impossible or inconsistent values.

  Secure project design

--- Collect only the identifiers you need: (Are postcodes adequate?)
--- Separate identifiers and research data where possible (instrument or system).
--- Use a robust, non-meaningful RECORD ID (auto-number or pseudo-ID) 
--- Use free-text fields sparingly
--- Configure file uploads fields only where necessary
--- Indicate explicitly consent, withdrawal and data-deletion flags.

In longitudinal studies, ensure that arms and events reflect study design accurately; mis-assignment may expose data to the wrong users or sites. When multiple sites participate in a study, use DAGs and arms to distinguish them. Decide whether surveys are anonymous or linked to records and show it in fields

  Survey Security and Participants

--- Use unique survey links or automatic invitations when controlling respondants. If public links are used, --- Consider:
CAPTCHA or ‘Aare you human?’ measures 
Monitoring response patterns for spam
  Provide information and consent text explaining:
      What data is collected.
      How it will be stored and used.
      Who will have access to it.
  Remind participants:
Not to enter others’ personal data unless consented to.
To avoid shared/public computers for sensitive surveys

  Mobile App and Offline Data

The REDCap Mobile App allows offline data collection with data stored locally on the device and synced later. 

--- Sensitive data encryption occurs locally and is transmitted via SSL. 
--- Try to ensure that only secure devices (PIN/biometric, device encryption) are used
--- Protect the app with a strong PIN; do not share secure protection services
--- Sync data to the server as soon as practical; delete local data
--- Document procedures for reporting lost or stolen devices
--- NEVER enable mobile app for high-risk projects unless local policy explicitly allows
  
  API and Systems Integration

The REDCap API enables programmatic access (R, Python, SAS, ETL pipelines, EHR integration). The API is powerful and therefore high-risk if misused.
  
  Good practice:
      Issue API TOKENS to users/projects that use them in their job profiles
      Never embed API tokens in code, public repositories or shared documents
      Restrict API access by IP address or network wherever possible.
      Use server-to-server connections from trusted environments (secure compute, TRE), not from personal laptops where feasible.
      Log and monitor API use; revoke tokens no longer required

  External Modules and Plugins

--- External modules extend REDCap’s functionality but can introduce security or privacy risks if they interact with third-party services.
--- Maintain a list of approved modules, with version control and security review.
--- Understand whether a module will issue data to cloud services; and if so, ensure data processing agreements are in place.
--- Document which modules are enabled, project requirement and termination date
  
  Data Export and Analysis

--- REDCap supports exports to Excel/CSV, PDF and statistical packages (R, SPSS, Stata, SAS).
--- Use REDCap’s de-identification options in the export tool 
--- Create separate exports for full identity unrestricted datasets and others
--- Store exported datasets in approved secure storage (TRE, organizational server).
--- NEVER email datasets or store them in unapproved cloud services.
--- Track who has copies of which exports, especially for high-risk data.
--- Apply appropriate access controls and retention policies.
 
 Regulatory and Ethical Considerations

--- REDCap can be configured to meet HIPAA, GDPR and other standards. Studies that require highly sensitive data could require additional measures, such as:
--- A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA).
--- Data processing agreements with hosting institutions or third parties.
--- Explicit consent 
--- High-risk data (genetic, mental health, rare diseases) may require extra safeguards such as restricted access, additional approvals, or specialised secure environments. Consult a suitable regulation and complicant expert; Data Protection Officer or similar

--- Training and Ongoing Maintenance
      Mandatorily insist on security and privacy training for all REDCap users
      Maintain project-specific policies and practices for
      User onboarding and offboarding.
      
  Data entry and quality checks.

--- Export procedures and analysis environments.
--- Incident reporting.
--- Timetable regular reviews:
User rights and active accounts (remove users who no longer need access).
Use DAG assignments.
Update procedures following data quality results and detection of outliers.

  Project privacy procedures and processes
      Incident Detection and Response
  Examples of incidents include: Unauthorised user access or incorrect user rights, including incorrect recipient of protected data, Lost or stolen Devices with protected data stored locally, and misconfiguration of projects that permits unauthorised researchers to access data. Immediate response guidelines are as follows:

      --- Contain
          Revoke or adjust user access; disable API tokens; lock surveys 
      --- Report
          Inform REDCap admin and institutional IT security promptly.
      --- Remediate
          Fix misconfigurations; retrain users; update policies and practices
      --- Investigate
          Use REDCap logs to establish facts; what, when and to which records
      --- Notify
          Notify affected participants and regulators according to legislature

** Document all actions in line with institutional incident management procedures.
