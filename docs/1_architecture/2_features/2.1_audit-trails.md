A. Viewing User Activity Logs for Audit and Governance Purposes

*    A User's global account logs and roles assigned can be accessed via Control Center > Logging
*    A filter can be used to interpret users, projects and actions, including data exports and login timestamps; in     some cases, this includes IP addresses.*

B. Audit Trails for Permission Changes

*    Tracking changes to users' rights is possible for at user and project levels.
    - From within the project, use the Project Logging pages to view changes to:
    <span style="color: red;" 

            ----> User roles
            ----> Data access permissions
            ----> Survey form rights (creation, data entries) </span>*
