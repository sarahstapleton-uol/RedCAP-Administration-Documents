### 2.4 Longitudinal Data 


The significance of longitudinal data in clinical trials and research projects requires no elucidation. However, it can be beneficial to visualize how RedCAP uses the tools available to design a skeleton for a project for branching that runs in parallel through a project. Its useful lifecycle must reach beyond a single survey or form and they are frequently implemented in multiple, independent projects. An instrument is assigned to an event within an arm.

An Instrument is typically a form or a questionnaire. Examples available to RedCAP Designers/Administrator's are: 
  ----------------------------------------------
  • Demographics
  • Medical History
  • Clinical Data
  • Adverse Events
  • Biomedical Samples
  • Reported Outcomes Survey
