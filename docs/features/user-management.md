A. New REDCap Accounts 

This section describes how to use account creation features. REDCap administrators configure local accounts from their own account. To prooceed, login to a project as an Administrator.

- Go to the Control Center in the topmost menu
- Find 'Add Users' and in the left margin's menu and beneath User Accounts, click Add Users
- Select 'Create a new Table-Based user'
- Enter a Username and Email address pair 

>>> Username: Choose a unique login name (adaLovelace)
>>> Email: Enter an email suitable for receiving notifications and password reset options

- Click 'Create User' to activate the account

Note: A user is not a member of a project at this stage. Users are assigned to the project via the project's User Rights page. 

B. Add Users to a Project

- From the project menu, select User Rights
- Choose the user's username from an existing institutional login, email or REDCap account
- Click Add with Custom Rights or assign the user to an existing User Rights role.

Note: Users must have a REDCap account before being added. A user is considered to have an account when they exist in the environment and it is a distinct step described in the section New REDCap accounts.

C. User Rights Matrix

Each user has rights and each right permits an action, or access to a specific feature. A description of rights appears when the mouse is hovered over the checkboxes. Examples of some common user permissions include:

Design and Setup – Allows users to edit instruments and project settings

User Rights – Grants a designated user or users the ability to manage other users

Data Entry Forms – Controls view/edit rights and must be set per instrument

Data Export – Controls access to export options and secure anonymisation tools


D. Custom User Roles

A role is the name granted to grouped sets of permissions that can be re-assigned to multiple users. Roles support administrative management of roles with access at various levels of control. This is extremely useful for managing larger teams and reduces human error.

- Choose Create Role in the User Rights section of the project

- Configure users rights by manually selecting any number of checkbox options to simplify adding multiple users to identical roles access 

E. Data Access Groups (DAGs)

While not a permission per se, DAGs restrict users views of data to within their assigned group, which ensures multiple levels of access are permitted by different research teams. The DAG can be assigned under the Data Access Groups tab.
