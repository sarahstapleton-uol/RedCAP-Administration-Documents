Some useful guidelines for administrators are:

Grant User Rights permissions to trustworthy team members incrementally. Management of this principle is supported by defined roles for research assistants, coordinators, and analysts duties, which should be regularly reviewed to ensure functional utility and security.

Responsibility for data export/download rights of users, verification that appropriate organizational policies, including governance frameworks such as HIPPA / GDPR, are adhered to remains the responsibility of the Project Administrator for the duration. 

The Principal Investigator is not necessarily the Project Administrator. Some projects prefer to hold the contact information for the Principal Investigator in Project Settings on REDCap.
