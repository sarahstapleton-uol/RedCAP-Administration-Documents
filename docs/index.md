# Welcome to the MkDocs pages for RedCAP Administrators

Welcome to the REDCap Project Administration Guide, designed to support administrators managing healthcare research projects using REDCap.

This brief guide is intended to assist new REDCap users from within the University of Liverpool's partnerships to effectively navigate the interface in a responsible and user-aware way while ensuring data security and compliance.

To the left of this paragraph is a menu (dropdown, three horizontal lines), and sections will hold a small number of essential **'How-to' guides** for frequent tasks including:

- User permissions
- Data quality validation
- Survey instrument changes

Feedback and recommendations from external stakeholders are welcome at:
